## Knight Travails

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum. It finds the shortest path a knight can take to move from one square to another on a standard 8x8 chessboard.

- **Movement:** The knight moves in an "L" shape: either two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular.
- **Algorithm:** The solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the starting position, tracking the path taken to each square.
- **Output:** When the knight reaches the target square, the program outputs the sequence of moves required to get there.
- **Implementation:** Written in JavaScript, the program can be run in a web browser or in a Node.js environment.
